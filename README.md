# Random-String-Cpp
Just a random string generator that uses vectors.

Hi! Welcome to my first ever project that has been published to the GitHub!

As title suggests this program is just a random string generator.
I've tried to use :  STL, Dynamic Memory, Strings and fstream.
If you have noticed, I also used classes and honestly I dont know why.

If you like to change your output file:
  1. In main.cpp there is a function called file.open()
  2. The file directory should be in the first parameter or in the quotation marks.
  3. Be careful though! Some compilers will give you an error if the path has \\ as it can be interpreted as an escape sequence
    So be sure to change them to -> '/'
